		<h2 style='margin: 0;'>A unique fixed fee estate agency tailored to suit your requirements</h2>
		<p>The Chamber Practice is a successful firm of solicitors and estate agents who specialise in conveyancing and estate agency.</p>

		<p>We market property for a fixed low fee service and we only collect payment once your property has been sold. We work hard to sell your property before we earn a fee and that's how it should be. You shouldn't pay for a service before it's been delivered- just as you wouldn't pay for a meal in a restaurant before eating.</p>

		<p>Our promise is to market and advertise your property in a manner that involves no risk to you and we believe that in this we represent an honest and true value proposition. This is the core of our business- we challenge you to find that in any other low fee Estate Agents.
