			<h2>What is included in estate agency fee?</h2>
			<p>Our Â£595 fixed estate agency fee is paid only once we sell your property and applies to any house at any value. Beware of other low cost operators who make you pay upfront and do very little to sell your property. You have to ask yourself what is their motivation for an agent to sell your house once they have your hard earned money. Some operators even charge you more money after six months if they fail to sell your house. Be on your guard for these types of operators.</p>

			<h2>Why should I use Move Right?</h2>
			<p>We are a well-established, respected solicitors and estate agents who have been trading for 10 years in Scotland. We want to provide sellers in the Lothian area a more transparent upfront and honest service where we don't take a fee until we have actually <span style='text-transform: uppercase;'>performed</span> for you.</p>

			<h2>Why do you think you are the best of the low cost ESPC agents?</h2>
			<p>We believe we offer a better service than any of the other low cost operators who we know are not inundated with complaints about poor service levels.
				It is easy to disguise how bad your service really is by only showing positive reviews from clients.</p>

			<h2>Do you compete with the higher fee estate agents?</h2>
			<p>We believe we offer everything most of the run of the mill estate agencies offer, particularly the ones that charge 1% or below. We don't aim to compete with the top end estate agents and we are honest enough to state these agents provide a more comprehensive service. We respect what these agents stand for, but it does come out at a higher price.</p>

			<h2>Why do some low cost agents quote inaccurate figures on their website?</h2>
			<p>The reality is the figures on their website are lower than what they actually charge. This is to reel you in with a low headline rates and then make excuses that some of their low advertised fees are only applicable for lower valued properties. This approach is unethical and is why we exist to provide a more honest and transparent service.</p>
			<p>We know of one low fee agent that is notorious for requesting significant fees upfront. This is misleading the consumer and we are campaigning to expose these agents.</p>

			<h2>Why don't you advertise your low fee on sales boards or on your sales brochures?</h2>
			<p>Beware of low cost agents who do this. We believe we should be going all out in the marketing of you property, not promoting our services to attract more business on your brochure or for sale board.</p>

			<h2>Does advertising low fees on for sale boards attract low offers?</h2>
			<p>Absolutely - it is a proven fact that buyers who see cheap fees advertised on for sale boards are motivated to try their luck with low offers. You only have to look at other low fee agent websites to see property advertised below market value. We work hard for you and you should not work for us by taking up valuable space on your for sale board or sales brochure advertising our business and our low fees.</p>
