			<h2>What is included in estate agency fee?</h2>
			<p>Our £595 fixed estate agency fee is paid only once we sell your property and applies to any house at any value. Beware of other low cost estate agents who make you pay upfront and do very little to sell your property. You have to ask yourself what is their motivation for an estate agent to sell your house once they have your hard earned money. Some estate agents even charge you more money after six months if they fail to sell your house. Be on your guard for these types of estate agents.</p>
			<p>We will list your property on our own website and on the relevant Solicitors Property Centre (subject to you meeting these marketing costs). We will handle all enquiries about your property and negotiate the sale on your behalf.</p>

			<h2>Is your fixed fee a promotional offer?</h2>
			<p>No- our low fixed fee is here for good, and it's part of why we are determined to offer more transparency than other low fee agents. Some agents offer 0% commission, but often only for a limited period and with many caveats. You have to ask yourself - if they cannot negotiate a fee for their service, how are they going to be able to negotiate a good offer for your property?

			<h2>Why should I use The Chamber Practice?</h2>
			<p>We are a respected firm of solicitors and estate agents who have been trading for over 10 years in Scotland. We want to provide sellers in the Lothian area a more transparent, upfront and honest service where we take payment only after offering you the best service possible. </p>

			<h2>Why are you different from other low cost estate agents?</h2>
			<p>We stick to the home report value and do everything we possibly can to help achieve the best possible price for you. We do not take payment in advance. We do not take commission from third parties. We will not charge you additional fees. The advertised rate of &pound;595 plus VAT is the only Estate Agency Fee you will pay to The Chamber Practice, regardless of the length of time your property is on the market.</p>

			<h2>Why do you think you are the best of the low cost ESPC agents?</h2>
			<p>You will find our commitment to customer service superior to other low cost estate agents. It's easy to disguise how bad your service really is by filtering your client's feedback, so you should always be wary of low cost agents who have edited their reviews. </p>

			<h2>Do you compete with the higher fee estate agents?</h2>
			<p>We believe we offer everything most estate agencies offer, particularly the ones that charge 1% or below. We're not aiming to compete with the top end estate agents, (such as Saville, Knight Frank, Simpson & Marwick or McEwan Fraser Legal) and we’re honest enough to state these agents provide a more comprehensive service. We respect what these agents stand for, but it does come at a higher price.</p>

			<h2>Why do some low cost agents quote inaccurate figures on their website?</h2>
			<p>The reality is that, in many cases, the figures on their website are lower than the final amount. A common tactic of low fee agents, this headline attracts customers who are then told that the fees quoted are only applicable for lower valued properties. This approach is unethical and is why we've been created- to provide an honest and transparent service. 
			<p>We know of one prominent low fee estate agency which is notorious for quoting a low sale fee and then requiring significant fees upfront. This is misleading to the consumer and we're campaigning to expose these agents with a detailed report to the office of fair trading.

			<h2>Why don't you advertise your low fee on "For Sales Boards" or on your sales brochures?</h2>
			<p>Beware of low cost agents who do this. We believe the focus should be on <strong>your property</strong>, not promoting our services to attract more business by hijacking your brochure and for sale board.</p>

			<h2>Does advertising low fees on for sale boards attract low offers?</h2>
			<p>Absolutely - it's an industry fact that buyers who see cheap fees advertised on for sale boards are motivated to make lower offers. There are plenty of examples online of properties advertised on low fee agents' websites where the property sells for below market value. We work hard for you, not the other way round. </p>
